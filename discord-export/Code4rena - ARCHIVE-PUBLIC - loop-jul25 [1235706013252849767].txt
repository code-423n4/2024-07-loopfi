quotas contracts are used to charge an extra borrowing rate specific to each `CDPVault` borrowing from the `PoolV3` which is ranged between a min and a max set by the DAO, vote for now is controlled by the DAO but will be voted by users in the future

Hey Wardens, I pulled in the wrong commit and accidentally omitted a couple of small pendle contracts (total 100 sloc) that were supposed to be in scope. I've decided to add this in scope given that we're still pretty early into the competition and the sponsor would like this to be included. Please accept my apologies for missing this and for the late addition.

Stay tune for updates from @Jay | C4 and @kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇

Hi there, I'm wondering if the contracts are deployed on the mainnet? Should frontrunning/backrunning/sandwiching be taken into consider?


[07/31/2024 11:16] aka_bug_killer
And the action contracts should be used in delegatecalls from the user proxies. Only the flashloan callback is used by itself, am I understanding it correctly?

Assuming the content of this finding submission is indeed a security issue, the only fault is the wrong estimating risk.

Confused about the staking path, an user stakes through the MultiFeeDistribution.sol, and unstakes through the StakingLPEth.sol?


[08/03/2024 08:20] konfushon
agreed.


[08/03/2024 08:23] 0x04bytes
Hello friends, is the configuration in `config.js` the actual configuration that will be used to deploy contracts on mainnet?


[08/03/2024 08:38] 0x04bytes
As far as I know, the StakingLPEth is used to earn lpEth accumulated from interest passively. The token staked in MultiFeeDistribution is the dLP token. In order to get the dLP token, the stakers can use their minted lpEth token as liquidity in balancer's 80LOOP-20lpEth pool. After locking their dLP token for a certain period of time, the stakers can claim their rewards.

I see position actions calls vault deposit / withdraw,


[08/06/2024 19:23] ladboy233
but the position action function is guarded by onlyDelegateCall modifier...


[08/06/2024 19:23] ladboy233
so who calls position action?


[08/06/2024 20:24] olanre_waju
CDPVault.sol


[08/06/2024 20:39] ladboy233
but CDPVault.sol has this check so only the permissioned contract can call deposit


[08/06/2024 20:39] ladboy233
```solidity
    function modifyCollateralAndDebt(
        address owner,
        address collateralizer,
        address creditor,
        int256 deltaCollateral,
        int256 deltaDebt
    ) public {
        if (
            // position is either more safe than before or msg.sender has the permission from the owner
            ((deltaDebt > 0 || deltaCollateral < 0) && !hasPermission(owner, msg.sender)) ||
            // msg.sender has the permission of the collateralizer to collateralize the position using their cash
            (deltaCollateral > 0 && !hasPermission(collateralizer, msg.sender)) ||
            // msg.sender has the permission of the creditor to use their credit to repay the debt
            (deltaDebt < 0 && !hasPermission(creditor, msg.sender))
        ) revert CDPVault__modifyCollateralAndDebt_noPermission();

```


[08/06/2024 20:40] ladboy233
yeah I still wonder what is the permissionless function to trigger deposit if the position action function is guarded by onlyDelegateCall modifier


[08/06/2024 20:41] olanre_waju
start with deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidation....that's the flow


[08/06/2024 20:48] a_kalout
hey, you'll be "delegately" calling these functions from your proxy contract, check tests in `src/test/integration/PositionAction20.t.sol`, your proxy contract would be the owner of your position

Want to double check - the MultiFeeDistribution.sol is a fork of RadiantV2 rewards, which supports bounty, compounding and lpZapping. MultiFeeDistribution.sol also has a bunch of code related to those features, but seems LoopFi does not support them, as there is no related code for main logic. So these features are out of scope? @Tenet | Loop @anonme

How can we determine if each finding from WatchPug is a known issue (with no fix yet) or if it has already been addressed in the contest repo, considering we don't have access to the codebase that WatchPug audited?

Hi. Have you engaged the docswolf where necessary / possible? Also, I believe the sponsor has been responsive although, it's possible that they may not have been available this weekend. Our team can ping them tomorrow (Monday), as needed, if no one is getting responses.

Last thing, we ask that you keep communication professional, particularly in these audit channels. We appreciate your understanding. Thanks!


[08/11/2024 19:36] konfushon
Yes, I have tried the bot. Been using it since the audit started. It's actually pretty good. But somethings I believe need the team's intervention and explaining like quotas.


[08/11/2024 19:38] konfushon
It's been 12 days and they haven't answered any of my DMs. So yeah, would really appreciate it if you ping them

Btw what's the reason behind not letting judging and sponsor review happen at the same time?

Isn't the judge decision and sponsor decision like 2 different things that doesn't even agree with each other sometimes? 😂


[09/03/2024 08:36] cloudellie
Sponsors have the most context on their code base. That context is often critical to the judge’s ability to judge more nuanced issues.

[09/17/2024 07:26] afriauditor
so a simple maths to keep ur mind at ease
There are 185 issues in finding repo and sponsorship reviewed 1/3
So approximately 61 issues in the last 30 days. Thats a rate of 2 findings per day. 
2/3 of findings left using current rate should take another 60 days.
So we talking 17th November.
Judging should start by 17th November. And my guess is PJQA  first week of December.

Numbers dnt lie fam😅

Judging is nearly complete. There are a couple of issues with nuanced details that the judge is reviewing with the sponsor.

I can tell you why: sponsors disapeared for 1 month, then came back and confirmed dozens, and dozens of findings without verifying if they are valid
It turns out a lot of them were in fact invalid, and now judges have to clean up the mess

Hey bro,
Haven't received my reward yet, filled my tax form after the results came i.e a little bit late. I want to find out if there's something extra I have to do that I haven't done yet 

Thanks
